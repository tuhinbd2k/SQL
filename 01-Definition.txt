SQL is a standard language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in databases.

Our SQL tutorial will teach you how to use SQL in:
MySQL, SQL Server, MS Access, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, Postgres, and other database systems.

SQL is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases.

What is SQL?
------------
-SQL stands for Structured Query Language
-SQL lets you access and manipulate databases
-SQL is an ANSI (American National Standards Institute) standard

What Can SQL do?

-SQL can execute queries against a database
-SQL can retrieve data from a database
-SQL can insert records in a database
-SQL can update records in a database
-SQL can delete records from a database
-SQL can create new databases
-SQL can create new tables in a database

SQL is a Standard - BUT....
---------------------------
Although SQL is an ANSI (American National Standards Institute) standard, there are different
versions of the SQL language.

However, to be compliant with the ANSI standard, they all support at least the major commands (such
as SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT, WHERE) in a similar manner.

Note: Most of the SQL database programs also have their own proprietary extensions in addition to
the SQL standard!

Using SQL in Your Web Site
--------------------------
To build a web site that shows data from a database, you will need:

-An RDBMS database program (i.e. MS Access, SQL Server, MySQL)
-To use a server-side scripting language, like PHP or ASP
-To use SQL to get the data you want
-To use HTML / CSS to style the page

RDBMS
-----
RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System.

RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems such as MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, 
Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access.

The data in RDBMS is stored in database objects called tables. A table is a collection of related
data entries and it consists of columns and rows.

Look at the "Customers" table:

Example
-------
SELECT * FROM Customers;

A record, also called a row, is each individual entry that exists in a table. For example, there 
are 91 records in the above Customers table. A record is a horizontal entity in a table.

A column is a vertical entity in a table that contains all information associated with a specific
field in a table.
