Constraints
-----------
Constraints are used to limit the type of data that can go into a table. This ensures the
accuracy and reliability of the data in the table. If there is any violation between the
constraint and the data action, the action is aborted.

Constraints can be column level or table level. Column level constraints apply to a column,
and table level constraints apply to the whole table.

The following constraints are commonly used in SQL:
-NOT NULL      - Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value
-UNIQUE        - Ensures that all values in a column are different
-PRIMARY KEY   - A combination of a NOT NULL and UNIQUE. Uniquely identifies each row in a table
-FOREIGN KEY   - Uniquely identifies a row/record in another table
-CHECK         - Ensures that all values in a column satisfies a specific condition
-DEFAULT       - Sets a default value for a column when no value is specified
-INDEX         - Use to create and retrieve data from the database very quickly
