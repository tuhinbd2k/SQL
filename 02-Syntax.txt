Database Tables
---------------
A database most often contains one or more tables. Each table is identified by a name (e.g.
"Customers" or "Orders"). Tables contain records (rows) with data.

In this tutorial we will use the well-known Northwind sample database (included in MS Access
and MS SQL Server).

SQL Statements
--------------
Most of the actions you need to perform on a database are done with SQL statements.

The following SQL statement selects all the records in the "Customers" table:

Example
-------
SELECT * FROM Customers;

Keep in Mind That...
--------------------
SQL keywords are NOT case sensitive: select is the same as SELECT
In this tutorial we will write all SQL keywords in upper-case.

Semicolon after SQL Statements?
-------------------------------
Some database systems require a semicolon at the end of each SQL statement.

Semicolon is the standard way to separate each SQL statement in database systems that 
allow more than one SQL statement to be executed in the same call to the server.
